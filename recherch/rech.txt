MAC512 is a modern encryption method where the same key is used for signing and validating our tokens. 
This means that other applications need our secret to check the validity of the JWTs and thus can use
 it to issue new tokens. By switching to the asymmetric algorithm RSA256 we use a private key to sign
  our tokens. We can pass over the public key for validation to other partys, and they cannot issue new
   tokens by themselves.

With the following commands we can create our own keys. The new files public.pem as well as private.pem
we put afterwards in resources/certs of our Spring Boot application.


# create key pair
openssl genrsa -out keypair.pem 2048

# extract public key
openssl rsa -in keypair.pem -pubout -out public.pem

# extract private key
openssl pkcs8 -in keypair.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -inform PEM -outform PEM -out private.pem
